# Village

Village is an app intended to help students who are struggling with mental health or executive functioning issues set, manage, and achieve goals at school using mindfulness techniques and support. The app enables counselors to sit down with students, set goals and record strategies to help students achieve their goals. Students can then use the app to review the plan they made with their counselor and to "Check-in" with status updates when they are experiencing symptoms, like test anxiety, trouble focusing in class, etc. The "Check-in" feature encourages students to become aware of how their body and emotions change in response to these situations, which overtime will increase their awareness and ability to manage their stress.
